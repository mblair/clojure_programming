Clojure Programming
===================

I'm reading [Clojure Programming](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013754.do) by Chas Emerick, Brian Carper &amp; Christophe Grand.

[This](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/191-rubyconf2009-clojure-for-ruby-programmers) video made me want to learn Clojure. You should watch it too.
